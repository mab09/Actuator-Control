# Actuator Control

Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle (ROV) constitutes half of the Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV), the other half being Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). 

As the name suggests ROVs are vehicles capable of operating underwater with the help of human input. The utility of ROVs have grown over the years ranging from applications in science to that in military. 

A need has risen to establish an easier and reliable method of developing ROVs with the help of devices such as microcontrollers. In this project, we make use of a microcontroller and various other tools in an effort to develop an aspect of the propulsion systems used by ROVs. 

To interface an analog joystick with a microcontroller in order to control the direction and speed of propulsion of an underwater vehicle with the help of servomotors and thrusters. This would require the use of a basic microcontroller such as the Arduino Uno, with the corresponding IDE installed in a computer to configure the microcontroller.  

Hence, broadly we need to accomplish the following- 

1. Interface the Joystick and Servomotor with the microcontroller 

2. Establish control for the speed of a propeller/thruster 

3. Assemble the vehicle 

4. Test underwater 

Here we shall primarily concentrate on the first two parts of this project i.e. Interfacing the joystick and servomotor with the microcontroller and establishing control for the speed of a propeller/thruster.
